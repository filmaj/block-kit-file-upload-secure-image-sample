Playing around with a workflow for uploading and displaying an image in Slack, without worrying about file permissions.

# Quickstart

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
2. With the Slack CLI, run `slack run`
3. Create the detected trigger if you haven't already
4. Post the trigger into a channel, invite the bot to the channel, and then trip the trigger. Upload an image file. It is then displayed in channel.
